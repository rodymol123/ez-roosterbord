- arrow keys: up/down change week, left/right change target (if arrows are displayed)
- display couplings between messages and entities in upload.php
- make targets same width with selectbox if "<" and ">" are present
- indicate empty moments (if a lesson is coupled to a room only, then this can't be
  discerned from the display, which is bad)
- on homepage: indicate in list who has changes
